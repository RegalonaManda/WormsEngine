# Worms-Engine
To test our knowledge on fundamental game physics we created a WORMS-like game. The game has at least one player worm that is able to shoot physics-enabled weapons/items to targets.

## Description

A 2D Worms like game to learn how to create a physics engine. 

## Key Features

- Many physical features like: bouncing, gravity, drag, hydrodynamic and aerodynamic, friction.
- Shoot the other players and kill them before they kill you, but don't try to swim
- Only one hp so don't kill yourself

## Personal Experience

//oye esto os dejo que pongais lo q querais porq yo al final pa la chusta que he hecho tmpoco he tenido muchos problemas, me refiero la mayoria habran suido haciendo las collisions y las fisicas
